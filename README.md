Hello Welcome to ur project.
we focii codes have created a functional website which uses math to calculate bmi and shows it you,
the main usp of our website is t that it provides paticular nutrition hard to specific age group and gender.(supposse if you choose childhood and chose female in gender then it show nutrition chart for girl child ,,  whereas if you choose childhood and male in gender then it shows boy child nutrion chart that is how we have put our algorith to use )
the adding of information related to or partnership(future thoughts) with  ngo is plus point for our webstie as it provides a relatabily and a trustable factor.

IN this world people suffering hunger is problem we need to solve. the inspiration to make tihs website came from a youtube video about hunger and poverty in India and Africa ,so we decided to build this project.
In today's world people do eat food but hey are not informer or dont know about daily nutrition requirement which leads to bigger problems like malnourishment or other health diseases like fever and weakness or early death.
Even our governmet is trying to promote and provide good nutrition food. The prime minister of India once said in one of hius vides about people in his village eating only bajra roti (bread) with sugar . Althugh being a tasty food it does not fullfill body's dialy nutrition requirement. 
Here comes our website's role that we provide information to you regarding nutrition.

Future plan's

1- to add ai image scanner to find out the body conditions of people using our website
2- to get connected as ngo with government and provide facilitiestohelp people dieing of hunger and provide basic nutrition education to people 
3- take data of poeple using our website (basic data just like location with government's order, so that we cna find out where max people are using our website and than we can send a team to that respective place to do inperson  meeting with the people and with government's help provide them required things

4- There can be situation where people who are not able to buy food; will not use our website or how will they . so to solve this we can provide contact details and a person from their village can contact us and ngo team wil there to help.
